- 👋 Hi, I’m @manusanchezv and I'm a working Mom from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and eventually being able to work as a programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via FreeCodeCamp and I just started the CS50x course. Pretty excited!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... As of right now, I can probably do some documentation translations maybe. Give me a little time and I'll tell you if there's anything else.
- 📫 How to reach me: via email!
